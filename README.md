# personal-website

(Projects may take time to load in! I'm using the cheapest tier for my SQL server on Azure)

A full stack website with React.js being used for the front end and ASP.NET Core and Microsoft SQL Server being used for the back end. 
Deployed using Azure web app services and then taken down immediately after I saw the price.
The SQL Server is on Azure, but the front end is now hosted on Netlify.

Live Website : https://joshualee.co.nz

Technologies Used include : React.js, ASP.NET Core, C#, Microsoft SQL Server, Azure Web App Services


(Note that Mobile Version is currently in development as of Jan 19)
