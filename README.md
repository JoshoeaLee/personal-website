# personal-website

(Projects originally loaded in via SQL but that cost money so it's all local now. Original code for when I was using SQL to load things in is still there, just commented out)

A full stack website with React.js being used for the front end and ASP.NET Core and Microsoft SQL Server being used for the back end. 
Deployed using Azure web app services and then taken down immediately after I saw the price.
The SQL Server is on Azure, but the front end is now hosted on Netlify.

Live Website : https://joshualee.co.nz

Technologies Used include : React.js, ASP.NET Core, C#, Microsoft SQL Server, Azure Web App Services
